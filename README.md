# euclid-game.kotlin
This is intended to be a Kotlin/Android port of [Euclid the Game](https://github.com/kasperpeulen/euclidthegame) and its [iOS app](https://github.com/euclidthegame/euclidthegame.iOS).

Eventually it may target other JVM platforms, possibly including iOS via [RoboVM](https://robovm.com/).
